Homework1 - Due Thursday, September 8th at 11:55 pm
Start early!

For Homework 1 you'll be implementing a class called CashRegister. 
The CashRegister has 7 methods. You will need to decide what
data structures and class variables are necessary to support those 
7 methods.

I've already implemented a class called Currency.
There are 10 forms of currency representing the 10 most common froms of US currency.
You shouldn't need to make any changes to this file to complete this assignment.

I've given you some example test cases to start in Tests.java. However,
I'll be using a different set of tests to determine your grade.
Feel free to add your own tests as you're doing the assignment.

You only need to submit CashRegister.java and Currency.java (if you've changed it).

As always, feel free to e-mail me with any questions (mscott31@spelman.edu).
